*The program* simulates the image intensities *produced* by **summing** random phasors *for different numbers of images (N)*. 

For each N, the process involves the following steps:

1. Simulating for single image
	* Each image intensity is derived from a sum of random phasors. 
	* The phasor phases($\theta_n$) are uniformly distributed in $[0,2\pi)$, ensuring randomness: `np.random.uniform(0, 2*np.pi, image_size)`. 
	* The intensity at each pixel is computed using the squared magnitude of the summed phasor components:
		$I = (\sum_{n=1}^{num\_phasors} {cos(\theta_n)})^2 + (\sum_{n=1}^{num\_phasors} {sin(\theta_n)})^2$ 

2. Summation across images:
	For each N, the program simulates N such intensity maps and computes their pixel-wise sum to generate the final intensity map:
	$I_{total}(x, y) = \sum^N_{n=1} I_i(x, y)$ 

3. Contrast Calculation   
	* The contrast(C) is defined as the ratio of standard deviation of intensity to the mean intensity: $C=\frac {\sigma_z} {mean(I_z)}$.
	* Numerically, this is implemented as `np.std(intensities)/np.mean(intensities)`. 
   
4. Visualization of simulated image intensities
	* The intensity maps for various N values are visualized by `ply,imshow(intensities, cmap='gray')`. 
	* For smaller N, the maps exhibit speckle-like patterns with high intensity variance. 
	* As N increases, the patterns become smoother, and the intensity variations diminish due to averaging.

5. Plotting the Contrast vs. N:
	- The program repeats the above steps for multiple N values, recording the contrast C for each.
	- A plot is generated to compare the observed contrast (C) with the theoretical curve $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$â€‹. The program verifies the overlap between the two, demonstrating that the relationship $C \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ holds.
