*Describe* the physical phenomenon 

# Acoustic Waves
Propagation through **matter(solids, liquids, gasses)** by *oscillation(effect of)* of pressure or displacement(actual moving)
* Acoustic waves generates sound and vibration
* Can travel in any matter
* No heat(no fraction is caused) or mass(molecule only moves very locally) transferred, only transferring energy.
* Can be reflected, refracted, diffracted, and/or attenuated
* For medium stiffness K and density p, speed $C_s = \sqrt {K/p} ms^{-1}$

## Two basic acoustic waves
### Longitudinal waves
variations around equilibrium pressure due to compression and rarefaction of medium in the direction of propagation

### Transverse waves
have surface deformations perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation

### Composition of basic waves
**Superposition** of different waves can cause particles to move in elliptical trajectories 椭圆轨迹 with depth-dependent direction. In liquids, particles move in anti-clockwise circular trajectories.

 **DOF** Degree of Freedom (particle move parallel to the direction of traveling)

# Electromagnetic Radiation
![[L4-Light&Sound-20241018135155221.webp]]

**"Light" is a kind of electromagnetic radiation** with particular ranges of wavelength $\lambda$, Ultraviolet（10-390nm）, visible(390-760), infrared(760-1000 000nm)

>[!definition] Synchronized oscillations of electric and mag, fields propagating at max speed $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 ms^{-1}\quad v = c/\lambda$

For shorter range and high data transfer we use high frequency, THz, GHz
For longer range to propagation data with less transferring frequency, we use low frequency MHz, KHz.

# Vector
$v = a \vec{i} +b\vec{j} + c\vec{k} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ in a Euclidean coordinate system
magnitude $||v||$ 
- Scalar(dot) product:  $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = ||v|| \cdot ||w|| cos(\theta) = ax + by + cz$
- Vector(cross) product: $||\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|| = ||v|| \cdot ||w|| sin(\theta)$ 
  $\vec{v} \times \vec{w}$
  The final vector will be perpendicular to both $\vec v$ and $\vec w$

## Vector fields and calculus

a scalar field is an assignment of a scalar to each point in space; similarly, a vector field is an assignment of a vector. A field can be consider as a **function**, e.g.
$$
\mathbf{F}:(x,y,z,t) -> (F_x, F_y, F_z)
$$
Vector Calculus is concerned with differentiation and integration of such function. Space and time can be omitted to improve readability but remember them.
