The goal of this project is to create a VR application that would allow people to *join an art gallery* and explore it. This application will work with a virtual reality headset and will allow users to *interact with each other and the art*, as well as the ability to *create their own art*. Users who don't have a virtual reality headset will be able to join the art gallery via a *desktop application*. Users will be able to *create their own art alone or collaboratively within the gallery*, have the *option to save their art to their device*, and *submit it to a public gallery*. It will be possible to have **multiple instances of the art galleries** hosting users at the same time. We would like the ability for users to submit the art they draw to *a public gallery that only shows user art*.

In the application, each user will be able to join and visit an existing art gallery session (**public or private**), see and hear other visitors and interact with them in real-time, interact with some of the objects in the art gallery, create their own art within the application, submit it to the gallery, and *save the art to their file system*. **The featured art will be a mixture of existing art, user-created art, and AI-generated art**. The art creation will be collaborative. In other words, multiple users can work on the same piece of art.

Some of the major challenges of this project include the *networking part* where we allow multiple users to join the art galleries/have multiple art gallery sessions taking place, *sharing the gesture tracking and head movement tracking* of the people in the gallery, and allowing users to paint in the gallery. If time allows it, we would also like to work on customization of the base art gallery to allow users to create their own personal art gallery with the art they have chosen, whether it be user-generated art, AI art, or some default art within the system.Â 

The art gallery room should:

- Support interaction with the environment through a headset: For example, the user should be able to paint on a canvas existing in the VR scene with others, where the other users can see what is being painted and can also paint on the same canvas;
- From a desktop application, enable a user to look around the VR scene, and have interactions similar to the headset application;
- Allow users to save their art and/or submit it to a public gallery
- Support a connection between the desktop and VR app;
- Support the user to see what their teammates are doing in real-time (their exact motion in real-time);
- Support multiple users joining the art gallery, with *voice transmission*.
- Allow host to define limit of users that can join
