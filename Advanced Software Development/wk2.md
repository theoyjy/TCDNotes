# Software Lifecycle Models -- Engineering System

### Characteristics
- Repeatable: re-use
- Responsible: best practices and ethics
- Systematic: planned, documented, analyzed
- Measurable: not only for the product but also the process

*Cost of changing gets higher as the project expands.*

### Waterfall
1. Requirement
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Integration Test
6. System Test
7. Regression Test

>[!warning] The objectives change over time, this methodology doesn't adapt well.
#### Rapid Prototyping
Still doesn't plan and test the sys architecture well in advance.

### Incremental

>[!success] Issues/Difficulties/Defects are highlighted earlier in the process and solutions are fed in to the remaining iterations. Clients can use parts of system sooner. 


### RUP Iterative Development

### Agile

Adapt the changes. Deliver the software frequently.

### Extreme Programming
