### 1. [Immersive Virtual Worlds for Social VR](https://projects.scss.tcd.ie/project/creating-immersive-virtual-worlds-for-social-vr/)
This project aims to develop detailed immersive virtual environments for social VR platforms, enhancing user engagement and interaction by leveraging advanced 3D modeling tools, and deploying them via social VR. By creating these virtual worlds, the project seeks to push the boundaries of social VR, offering richer and more immersive experiences for users through exploration in Human-Computer Interaction user-focused experiments.
The project will focus on:

- **High-Fidelity 3D Modeling**: Capturing real-world scenes with [3D reconstruction tools like Meshroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_O6tYKQEBA) and refining them for distribution using Blender to create realistic, optimized 3D models.
- **VR Scene Integration**: Building and optimizing immersive VR environments and deploying them to social VR platforms.
- **Enhanced Social Experiences**: Providing users with visually stunning and interactive virtual spaces that foster social connection, collaboration, and exploration.
#### Question
I am particularly interested in the 3D reconstruction aspect of the project. Could you clarify if the primary focus is on creating the most realistic VR scenes possible through tools like Meshroom, or if we are more focused on developing creative methods to make these virtual spaces highly interactive? I'd like to ensure I'm aligning my research direction appropriately.

#### Question
I would love to participate this project. Does this project involve with lots of AI technologies? I don't think my course will cover lots of these?

### [Serious Games and Interactive Storytelling](https://projects.scss.tcd.ie/project/serious-games-and-interactive-storytelling/)
IDN research is concerned with narrative in digital media that changes according to user input. Â It is a multi-disciplinary field that includes humanities-based and computational perspectives.

#### Question
I would love to participate this project. I am a student from AVR strand, should I learn other skills to be able to do this project? Such as psychology and literacy?

### 1. [Volumetric Video Editing Tool](https://projects.scss.tcd.ie/project/volumetric-video-editing-tool/)

I love to build up a volumetric video editing tool! But I just have a question, so for this project, I think the most of the workload is on building this tool, but dissertation is another thing right?
