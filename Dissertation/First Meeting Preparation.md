1. Could you recommend any resources or materials for getting started with volumetric video?
   
2. What are the expectations regarding the completion of the tool? Should the project be fully implemented, and will my code be examined? Is it necessary to develop a polished UI, or is the focus primarily on functionality?
   
3. Are there any specific deadlines or milestones I should be aware of?
   
4. I assume that the primary focus of the dissertation will be on the manipulation and handling of the data structure of volumetric videos. Is that correct?
   
5. Could you clarify how often weâ€™ll meet for feedback during the project?
   
6. Will there be additional resources or assistance available if I encounter challenges, especially with technical aspects like volumetric video data structures?
   
7. How much room is there for creativity and innovation within the project? Are there any specific areas where you'd like me to explore new techniques or approaches?
