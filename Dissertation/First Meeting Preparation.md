1. We are supposed to submit the background around the Christmas, I would like to ask if you would **prefer to review this section before the official submission**. If so, would you prefer to see the **complete** background section once it is finalized, or would you prefer to review **draft versions during the writing process**?

2. Could you clarify **how often weâ€™ll meet for feedback** during the project?

1. Could you **recommend any resources or materials** for getting started with volumetric video?
   
2. What are the **expectations regarding the completion of the tool**? Should the project be fully implemented, and will my code be examined? Is it necessary to develop a polished UI, or is the focus primarily on functionality? 
   
3. Could you please *advise on* what **percentage of my total dissertation time** should be *allocated* to the **development of the tool**?
   
   Overlapping: 10-15% intro, background, **15% implementation**, 15% evaluation, conclusion and results.
   
4. Will there be additional resources or assistance available if I encounter challenges, especially with technical aspects like volumetric video data structures?
   
5. Are there any specific areas where you'd like me to explore **new techniques or approaches**?
