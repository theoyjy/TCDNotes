# Step 1: Define the Vision and Goals
What problem it is solving, why the system is being built

- Outline business goals and success metrics
- Set short-term and long-term goals

# Step 2: Gather and Prioritize Requirements
Collect what features and functionality the system must have

- **Create Epics**: Identify the large features or functionalities
- **Write User Stories & Prioritize them**

# Step 3: Develop a Product Roadmap and Backlog
Create a high-level plan for what needs to be built and in what order

- **Product Roadmap**: outline the timeline for major milestones and key features
- **Backlog**: a dynamic list of user stories and tasks that will be guide development

# Step 4: Design the sys Architecture
Plan how the system will be structured from a **technical perspective**.

- **Choose tech stack**
- **System Architecture Design**
- **Database Design**
- **API and Integration Points**

# Step 5: Set Up the Development Environment
Prepare the tools and environment that the team will use for development.

- **Version Control**: Set up Git, GitHub, GitLab, or another version control system to manage code.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Use tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI to automate testing and deployment.
- **Project Management Tools**: Use tools like Jira, Trello, or Azure DevOps to manage tasks, sprints, and progress tracking.
- **Development Frameworks**: Install necessary development tools, libraries, and frameworks (e.g., React, Node.js, or Django).
- **Testing Frameworks**: Implement automated testing tools (e.g., Jest, Mocha, or Selenium).

# Step 6: Plan Sprints and Iterations

Break the development into short, manageable cycles (sprints) that allow for frequent releases and feedback.

- **Sprint Planning**: Define what user stories will be tackled in the upcoming sprint. Typically, sprints last 1-4 weeks.
- **Assign Tasks**: Break down user stories into smaller tasks and assign them to team members.
- **Set Sprint Goals**: Determine the objectives for each sprint and what defines success.

# Step 7: Develop the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Build the smallest version of the product that delivers enough value to get feedback from users.

- **Develop Core Features**: Focus on *must-have features* that deliver core functionality.
- **Test Incrementally**: Continuously write and run automated tests to ensure quality and minimize bugs.
- **End-of-Sprint Review**: Demo completed work to stakeholders for feedback.

# Step 8: Test the System
Ensure the system works as expected and is free of major bugs.

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components of the system.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure different modules work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate real-world scenarios to validate the systemâ€™s overall functionality.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Allow end users or stakeholders to test the system in a real-world setting to ensure it meets their needs.

# Step 9: Review and Refine
Assess progress and make adjustments as needed.

- **Retrospective Meetings**: After each sprint, review what went well and what can be improved.
- **Update Product Backlog**: Based on feedback, add, remove, or prioritize user stories.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Adapt to new information or evolving requirements. Refine processes, design, or code as necessary.

# Step 10: Deploy the System
Release the system to production for users to start using.

- **Prepare for Deployment**: Ensure that the system is stable and thoroughly tested.
- **Deploy to Production**: Use CI/CD pipelines to deploy the system to production.
- **Monitor the System**: Set up monitoring and alerting to catch any issues in the live system.
- **Post-Deployment Testing**: Ensure the system is functioning as expected in the production environment.

# Step 11: Gather Feedback and Iterate
Use feedback to improve the system in future iterations.

- **Collect User Feedback**: Conduct surveys, interviews, or monitor usage analytics to gather feedback.
- **Plan Next Iterations**: Prioritize feedback and plan for future sprints.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Continue to fix bugs, improve performance, and roll out new features based on user needs.
