- light and sound are both physical waves

>[!info] Sound wave is variation of air pressure

- Simplifying the wave from radical waves to one wave.

### Amplitude

>[!tip] Amplitude Along Distance
>$A_{0}$ is the initial Amplitude. At the $r$ distance, the circumference of the circle is $2 \Pi r$, so $A_{0} = \frac {A_{0}} {2 \pi r}$. We short it to $A \propto r^{-1}$ in 2D propagation.
>>[!caution] In 3D,  $A \propto r^{-2}$
>>The surface of a sphere is $4 \pi r^{2}$, so at $r$, $A = \frac {A_{0}} {4 \pi r^{2}}$
 
>[!caution] Amplitude Along Time
>At a fixed point (fixed distance), the point goes up and down along time. 

* First derivative $\frac {dy} {dx}$ is the slope
* Second derivative $\frac {d^{2}y} {dx}$

#### Wave Equation - Constraint Equation

Second Partial Derivative of A(r, t) = 1/c^2 Second Partial Derivative of A(r, t)

>[!tip] **One** analytic solution can be expressed as the sum of two "wave shaped"
>$$
>A(r, t) = cos(kr-\omega t) + cos(kr+\omega t)
>$$

### Unit
- $C$ **Speed** in $m\space s^{-1}$, depends on the media substance
- $\lambda$ **Wave length** in $m$
* $T = \lambda / c$ **Wave Period** in $s$
* $v = 1/T$ **Wave Frequency** in $Hz$
* $\omega=2\pi / T$ **Angular Fraq** in $rad \space s^{-1}$
* $k = 2\pi / \lambda$ **Wave number** in $m^{-1}$

### Term
