# Introduction

>[!question] Definition
>CV enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, similar to how humans perceive and process images.
>
>Understand the scene in order to take actions: perception, planning, reasoning.
>
>Understand the location, materials of objects

## Image Acquisition
>[!info] Energy - illumination
>photon can be measured
>	by Energy $E$
>	frequency $f$
>	wavelength $\lambda$
>$\lambda = \frac {c} {f} \quad  E =h \times f  \quad E = \frac {h \times c} {\lambda}$

>[!info] The lens
>$\frac {1} {g} + \frac {1} {b} = \frac {1} {f}$
>g is distance between obj and lens
>b is the dis between lens and sensor
>f is focal length
>g is fairly long, could be omitted, so $b \approx f$
>- Depth of Field: change g without need to change b, the photo is still good
