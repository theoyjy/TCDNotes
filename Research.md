Focus the benefits of the tool, 
4D view
NERFs, Gaussian Splats(more easier)
Research question -- Some Objectives:
	gap, challenges(data so big), transitions, 



Test: compare with 3D animation creation, evaluation of the tool

Implementation:
- load OBJ
  ![[Research-20241125121550263.webp]]
	- maybe **GLTF** ï¼ˆSketchfab.com)
	- write script to load lots of OBJs
	- maybe own file format

**OBJ loader firstly**
Try out:
1. Base code strategy
2. Unreal engine might be lack of interface

Maybe one discussion after research canvas. Before Christmas

Only prototype.
