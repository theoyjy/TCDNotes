Post processing for assignment is beneficial

- Vision is for computer to see and understand the real world
- Graph is to use computers to show/render images/videos
- Visualization: visualize data
- Virtual Reality: connected closely with Graphics, and motion capture

Modeling -> Rendering(can be in any styles) -> Animation

Rendering: project 3D model in virtual space on a screen, with the consideration of viewpoint.
Visibility:  the overlap/hide relation of objects
Shading & Material: incoming light on the surface is scattered, and find out the amount light that is actually captured by eyes/cameras. Raytracing is helpful technique, but expensive. 

**Polygons** basic elements of models

## lab notes

>[!info] Graphics pipeline
>The process of transforming 3D coordinates to 2D pixels is managed by graphic pipeline:
>1. transform 3D coords into 2D coords
>2. transform 2D coords into actual color pixels
>**Parallel nature**: thousands of small process

### Vertex Buffer Objects(VBO)

>[!definition] 
>Storing large number of vertices in GPU's mem.
>The advantage of using those buffer objects is that we can send large batches of data all at once to the graphics card, and keep it there if there's enough memory left, without having to send data one vertex at a time. Sending data to the graphics card from the CPU is relatively slow, so wherever we can we try to send as much data as possible at once.

#### APIs

1. Each buffer has a unique ID, we can generate desired numbers of buffers
```cpp
unsigned int VBO;
glGenBuffers(number, &VBO);
```

2. Define the buffer type, which VBO is `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER`
```cpp
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
```
