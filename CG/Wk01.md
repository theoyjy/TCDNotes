Post processing for assignment is beneficial

- Vision is for computer to see and understand the real world
- Graph is to use computers to show/render images/videos
- Visualization: visualize data
- Virtual Reality: connected closely with Graphics, and motion capture

Modeling -> Rendering(can be in any styles) -> Animation

Rendering: project 3D model in virtual space on a screen, with the consideration of viewpoint.
Visibility:  the overlap/hide relation of objects
Shading & Material: incoming light on the surface is scattered, and find out the amount light that is actually captured by eyes/cameras. Raytracing is helpful technique, but expensive. 

**Polygons** basic elements of models

## lab notes

>[!info] Graphics pipeline
>The process of transforming 3D coordinates to 2D pixels is managed by graphic pipeline:
>1. transform 3D coords into 2D coords
>2. transform 2D coords into actual color pixels
>**Parallel nature**: thousands of small process
